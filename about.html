        <p>I just thought what they claim about being traditional and modern at the same time cannot provide great
          results. But - it actually does bring the unique experience. Their main goal is to make the guests feel great
          and that is not so common today! Definitely appreciated the time spent there! And looking formward to the next
          visit!</p>

      <div class="testimonial bg-primary">
        <img src="./img/person-2.jpg" alt="Jen">
        <p>Felt like home. Even if I really tried I am not able to find a single thing that could be perceived by me as
          below 'awesome'. You are feeling special as soon as you walk into this place. When you are surrounded by great
          people who work in this hotel, you start to realise you couldn't find a better place to stay. Thanks to the
          whole crew!
